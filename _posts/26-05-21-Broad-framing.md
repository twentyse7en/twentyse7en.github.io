Let's start with a question, would you accept a gamble on the toss of a coin in
which you could lose $100 or win $200.

I wouldn't go for the gamble, the loss of $100 weighs more than winning $200 for me.
I will take the gamble if it can be repeated 100 times. The question is taken from
Thinking fast and slow, as always my judgment was correctly predicted in the book.
I'm not surprised, as most of my judgments are predicted accurately in the book.

There is no reason to reject the gamble if it can be repeated 100 times. The expected
return is $5000 with a very low probability of losing any money(1/2300). The one who
rejects the single gamble is also prone to reject similar other gambles too. Because
each gamble is evaluated separately and rejected, like the decision we made at the
beginning. This is **narrow framing**, the decisions are taken separately.

Consider three tosses of the above gamble,  let's check the possible outcome and probabilities

- 12.5%  loss $600
- 37.5%  win $0
- 37.5%  win $300
- 12.5% win $600

I will take the deal as there is only 12.5% chance of losing something. But the
human are naturally narrow framer and If I was encountered with gamble independtly
at different occussion I will turn down. We need paper and pen to calculate probabilities,
our monkey brains are not good at this. We can reduce the pain of lossing the gamble
by having a **broader frame**, for favourable gamble the probability of losing reduces rapidly.

The author have a sermon for you If you still haven't convinced for taking a favourable gamble.

<em>
"I sympathize with your aversion to losing any gamble, but it is
costing you a lot of money. Please consider this question: Are you on
your deathbed? Is this the last offer of a small favorable gamble that
you will ever consider? Of course, you are unlikely to be offered
exactly this gamble again, but you will have many opportunities to
consider attractive gambles with stakes that are very small relative
to your wealth. You will do yourself a large financial favor if you are
able to see each of these gambles as part of a bundle of small
gambles and rehearse the mantra that will get you significantly
closer to economic rationality: you win a few, you lose a few. The
main purpose of the mantra is to control your emotional response
when you do lose. If you can trust it to be effective, you should
remind yourself of it when deciding whether or not to accept a small
risk with positive expected value. Remember these qualifications
</em>
- <em> It works when the gambles are genuinely independent of each
other; it does not apply to multiple investments in the same
industry, which would all go bad together.</em>
- <em> It works only when the possible loss does not cause you to worry
about your total wealth. If you would take the loss as significant
bad news about your economic future, watch it!</em>
- <em> It should not be applied to long shots, where the probability of winning
    is very small for each bet.</em>

*If you have the emotional discipline that this rule requires, you will never
consider a small gamble in isolation or be loss averse for a small gamble until
you are actually on your deathbed and not even then."*
