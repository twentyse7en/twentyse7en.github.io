Hi, I'm Abijith B currently final year undergraduate at [GECP](https://gecskp.ac.in/) with
Computer Science and Engineering as major.

I have a huge interest in backend development, mostly with python.
I have also tried frontend development with Flask and React.
I'm also exploring Machine Learning, my interested research areas
include recommendation and clustering. On free time I automate
some boring stuff and tweak my GNU/Linux Machine.

I have intereset in psychology and reading [Thinking fast and slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)
by Daniel Kahneman was a turning point of my life. I love cycling and badminton.
I also love watching cinema. Akira kurosawa, Andrei Tarkovsky, Satyajit Ray
and Martin Scorsese are my favorite directors.

## Work Experience
1. #### Google Summer of Code | Python Software Foundation
    Developed a feature for [LiberTEM](https://github.com/LiberTEM/LiberTEM/). Enhanced user experience
    by easier transition between GUI and scripting. User can
    download Jupyter notebook/Python script corresponding to
    an analysis made by user. Monitor cluster details in GUI and
    generate connection code.
