Hi, I'm Abijith B currently final year undergraduate at [GECP](https://gecskp.ac.in/) with
Computer Science and Engineering as major.  

I have a huge interest in backend development, mostly with python. 
I have also tried frontend development with Flask and React. 
I'm also exploring Machine Learning, my interested research areas 
include recommendation and clustering. On free time I automate
some boring stuff and tweak my GNU/Linux Machine.

I have intereset in psychology and reading [Thinking fast and slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)
by Daniel Kahneman was a turning point of my life. I love cycling and badminton.
I also love watching cinema. Akira kurosawa, Andrei Tarkovsky, Satyajit Ray
and Martin Scorsese are my favorite directors.

## Skils

**Language :** Python, C++, C, Javascript

**Databases :** PostgreSQL

**Misc :** Pandas, Numpy, React, Flask, Shell

## Projects:
1. #### [Book Recommendation Engine]():
    * Book recommendation system based on data from Goodreads. 
    * The approaches used are item affinity and Matrix factorization. 
    * Experimenting with ANN to measure the effect of the book cover on user rating.

2. #### [Kompressor](https://github.com/twentyse7en/kompressor)
    * Performs pixel-wise color quantization using K-Means.
    * Reducing the no. of colors in the image as the user specifies.

3. #### [Wi-mote](https://github.com/Dink4n/wi-mote)
    * Developed a full stack web application using Flask and React.
    * Control media on device over wifi.
    * Effortless connection using QR-code scanning.

## Work Experience
1. #### Google Summer of Code | Python Software Foundation
    Developed a feature for [LiberTEM](https://github.com/LiberTEM/LiberTEM/). Enhanced user experience
    by easier transition between GUI and scripting. User can 
    download Jupyter notebook/Python script corresponding to 
    an analysis made by user. Monitor cluster details in GUI and 
    generate connection code.
